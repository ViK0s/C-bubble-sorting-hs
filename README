# [Bubble sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) implemented in C++
This was a program that I have made during highschool to learn about sorting algorithms.
Unfortunately the variables were written in polish.
Made in Dev-C++ 5.11

## Usage
The repository has all project files including the ones that probably aren't needed for compilation.
Still, I would advise to use the Dev-C++ IDE to compile this, as it's the sure way of the program working properly.
